# hw3-password-generator

## Description

A password generator that accepts inputs from the user and uses those inputs to generate a password tailored to the users choices. CLicking the button will begin a series of prompts to determine the passoword's criteria. The user will choose whether to incluse lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or special characters, as well as the length of the password within the limits of 8 to 128 characters. The password will be checked to ensure at least one optional character type is chosen by the user, and that the chosen length is within the limit. A password is generated to meet the chosen criteria and then displayed to the screen in the text area.
